For example, two products may both be amoxicillin, but one is in 500 mg capsules and another is in 250 mg chewable tablets. The term unit dose can also sometimes encompass non-reusable packaging as well (especially when each drug product is individually packaged), although the FDA distinguishes that by unit-dose \"packaging\" or \"dispensing\". Depending on the context, multi(ple) unit dose can refer to distinct drug products packaged together, or to a single drug product containing multiple drugs and/or doses. The term dosage form can also sometimes refer only to the pharmaceutical formulation of a drug product's constituent drug substance(s) and any blends involved, without considering matters beyond that (like how it is ultimately configured as a consumable product such as a capsule, patch, etc.). Because of the somewhat vague boundaries and unclear overlap of these terms and certain variants and qualifiers within the pharmaceutical industry, caution is often advisable when conversing with someone who may be unfamiliar with another person's use of the term.\nDepending on the method/route of administration, dosage forms come in several types. These include many kinds of liquid, solid, and semisolid dosage forms. Common dosage forms include pill, tablet, or capsule, drink or syrup, and natural or herbal form such as plant or food of sorts, among many others. Notably, the route of administration (ROA) for drug delivery is dependent on the dosage form of the substance in question. A liquid dosage form is the liquid form of a dose of a chemical compound used as a drug or medication intended for administration or consumption.\nVarious dosage forms may exist for a single particular drug, since different medical conditions can warrant different routes of administration. For example, persistent nausea, especially with vomiting, may make it difficult to use an oral dosage form, and in such a case, it may be necessary to use an alternative route such as inhalational, buccal, sublingual, nasal, suppository or parenteral instead. Additionally, a specific dosage form may be a requirement for certain kinds of drugs, as there may be issues with various factors like chemical stability or pharmacokinetics. As an example, insulin cannot be given orally because upon being administered in this manner, it is extensively metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) before reaching the blood stream, and is thereby incapable of sufficiently reaching its therapeutic target destinations. The oral and intravenous doses of a drug such as paracetamol will differ for the same reason."}, "Arnaldo de Novais Guedes Rebelo": {"views": 89.71428571428571, "completeness": 94, "summary": "Arnaldo Nogueira de Novais Guedes Rebelo.

The same relationship is also applicable for the concentration of a solute adsorbed onto the surface of a solid and the concentration of the solute in the liquid phase. In 1909, Herbert Freundlich gave an expression representing the isothermal variation of adsorption of a quantity of gas adsorbed by unit mass of solid adsorbent with gas pressure. This equation is known as Freundlich adsorption isotherm or Freundlich adsorption equation. As this relationship is entirely empirical, in the case where adsorption behavior can be properly fit by isotherms with a theoretical basis, it is usually appropriate to use such isotherms instead (see for example the Langmuir and BET adsorption theories). The Freundlich equation is also derived (non-empirically) by attributing the change in the equilibrium constant of the binding process to the heterogeneity of the surface and the variation in the heat of adsorption.\n\n"}, "Killer heuristic": {"views": 672.0, "completeness": 451, "summary": "In competitive two-player games, the killer heuristic is a move-ordering method based on the observation that a strong move or small set of such moves in a particular position may be equally strong in similar positions at the same move (ply) in the game tree.\nRetaining such moves obviates the effort of rediscovering them in sibling nodes.\nThis technique improves the efficiency of alpha\u2013beta pruning, which in turn improves the efficiency of the minimax algorithm. Alpha\u2013beta pruning works best when the best moves are considered first.  This is because the best moves are the ones most likely to produce a cutoff, a condition where the game playing program knows that the position it is considering could not possibly have resulted from best play by both sides and so need not be considered further.  I.e. the game playing program will always make its best available move for each position.  It only needs to consider the other player's possible responses to that best move, and can skip evaluation of responses to (worse) moves it will not make.\nThe killer heuristic attempts to produce a cutoff by assuming that a move that produced a cutoff in another branch of the game tree at the same depth is likely to produce a cutoff in the present position, that is to say that a move that was a very good move from a different (but possibly similar) position might also be a good move in the present position.  By trying the killer move before other moves, a game playing program can often produce an early cutoff, saving itself the effort of considering or even generating all legal moves from a position.\nIn practical implementation, game playing programs frequently keep track of two killer moves for each depth of the game tree (greater than depth of 1) and see if either of these moves, if legal, produces a cutoff before the program generates and considers the rest of the possible moves.  If a non-killer move produces a cutoff, it replaces one of the two killer moves at its depth.  This idea can be generalized into a set of refutation tables.\nA generalization of the killer heuristic is the history heuristic The history heuristic can be implemented as a table that is indexed by some characteristic of the move, for example \"from\" and \"to\" squares or piece moving and the \"to\" square. When there is a cutoff, the appropriate entry in the table is incremented, such as by adding d\u00b2 or 2d where d is the current search depth. Beyond an incremental depth of about 2, history information rapidly degenerates into \"noise\".\n\n"}, "Divine Right (game)": {"views": 294.57142857142856, "completeness": 825, "summary": "Divine Right is a fantasy board wargame designed by Glenn A.

She is most recognised for her batik work and is one of the best-known batik artists in Australia. Her works also include acrylic paintings, weaving, ceramics, wood carving, and printmaking. Most of Tapaya's paintings depict places and events from her family's dreaming stories. Her batik work is of the classic Ernabella style, which eschews the Indonesian use of repeated block printed designs in favour of hand-drawn freehand designs or \"walka\". These \"walka\" are pure design and do not refer to, or contain reference to, dreamings or \"tjukurpa\".\nTapaya is a member of the Pitjantjatjara people. She was born in the desert in the far northwest of South Australia. Her mother had walked from Walytjitjata, in the Northern Territory, and arrived at Ernabella Mission shortly after Tapaya's birth. Ernabella was run by missionaries at the time, and Tjunkaya grew up there. The craft room at Ernabella Mission was established in 1948 and nurtured the artistic talents of Tapaya and other children and adults living on the mission. The craft room taught spinning and weaving originally but later added batik and painting to its activities, and later still became a professionally run Aboriginal-owned incorporated arts enterprise known as Ernabella Arts, after the mission was closed and the land returned to its traditional Pitjantjatjara owners.\nLike most early artists in her community, Tjunkaya's original style came from milpatjunanyi \u2013 an ancient Western Desert practice of drawing in the sand to tell stories to children. This is the basis of the classic Ernabella \"walka\".\nErnabella women began to be taught batik making in 1971. In 1974, Ernabella Arts sent Tapaya to Yogyakarta with several other Pitjantjatjara women to learn more about making batik from Indonesian artists.Tapaya's work has been shown in several exhibitions in Australia, Europe, North America, and Southeast Asia.

In contrast to some other fictitious faster-than-light technologies such as a jump drive, the warp drive does not permit instantaneous travel and transfers between two points, but rather involves a measurable passage of time which is pertinent to the concept. In contrast to hyperspace, spacecraft at warp velocity would continue to interact with objects in \"normal space\". The general concept of \"warp drive\" was introduced by John W. Campbell in his 1957 novel Islands of Space.Einstein's theory of special relativity states that speed of light travel is impossible for material objects that, unlike photons, have a non-zero rest mass. The problem of a material object exceeding light speed is that an infinite amount of kinetic energy would be required to travel at exactly the speed of light.

Shri Hari Singh came from a find tradition of great Indian Foresters. Among several other awards, he was awarded the Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), a distinguishing honor bestowed upon him by the British Government. He held India's highest office of forest administration, namely, Inspector General of Forests, from 1964 to 1969, and graced innumberable national and international bodies on the development of the forestry sector.\nHe recognized the importance of forests and gave them a respectable place in the Five-Year Plans. He was instrumental in enacting the 42nd. amendment of the constitution which brought forestry into the concurrent list. In 1966 he was responsible for the creation of the Indian Forest Service to cater to the need for inter-state coordination and uniformity of approach in dealing with the scientific management of forests and the environment.  The Indian Forest Service was the third all-India service to be created, the others being the Indian Administrative Service and the Indian Police Service. Having studied forestry at the Edinburgh, he joined the Bombay Presidency as a Forest Officer and set a new direction to forest management in the state. He later served as chief conservator of forests of Gujarat. Heading the Forest Department at the Centre, he is credited not only with constituting the Indian Forest service but also introducing the concept of \"social forestry\" in India, a policy to preserve the greenery of the area, provide firewood, prevent soil erosion as well as consolidation of unmade road shoulders. In India today there is a major wing of the Forest Department focussing on social forestry.\nDuring his tenure as Inspector General of Forests he exhibited a quality of leadership of the highest order. He gave a new orientation to the Forest Department plans by making them industry oriented. He was largely instrumental in the formulation of a very important development scheme, viz., Quick Growing Species. It is under his stewardship that this scheme made very good progress.\nHe initiated two U.N.D.P. Projects of very great importance for the country.  These projects Were:\n1. Pre-investment Survey of Forest Resources and\n2. Logging Training Centre Project.\nDuring the operation of the projects, he saw to it that local expertise in the subjects was developed, so that, after expiry of the U.N.D.P. projects they could be continued with local experts. He was largely responsible of the smooth and timely working of the projects according to schedule.\nRegarding his role as chairman of the IX Commonwealth Forestry Conference held from January 3, 1968 to January 27, 1968, Dr. M.R. Jacobs, Director General, Forestry and Timber Bureau, Australia, observed \"Shri Hari Singh conducted the conference with dignity, with fairness, with firmness when necessary; above all leading the discussion so that the essential problemsof forestery were constructively considered. There was a time when they thought that the Commonwealth Forestry Conference may have completed its usefulness. Delegates left this conference feeling that there is a definite future for them.  This was the result on the conference due to Shri Hari Singh.\"\nThe Government of India nominated Shri Hari Singh on various committees  and commissions. in the international field, he was elected Chairman of the F.A.O. Committee on Range Forest Management, Chairman of the Teak Sub-Commission, Chairman of the Technical Committee on Forestry and Forest PRoducts, 1965; Chairman of the Joint U.N.C.T.A.D./F.A.O.

Unlike the cuckoos and honeyguides, the indigobirds and whydahs do not destroy the host's eggs. Typically, they lay 2\u20134 eggs in with those already present. The eggs of both the host and the victim are white, although the indigobird's are slightly larger. Many of the indigo-plumaged species named \"indigobirds\" are very similar in appearance, with the males difficult to separate in the field, and the young and females near impossible. The best guide is often the estrildid finch with which they are associating, since each indigobird parasitises a different host species. For example, the village indigobird is usually found with red-billed firefinches. Indigobirds and whydahs imitate their host's song, which the males learn in the nest. Although females do not sing, they also learn to recognise the song, and choose males with the same song, thus perpetuating the link between each species of indigobird and firefinch. The nestling indigobirds mimic the unique gape pattern of the fledglings of the host species.\nThe matching with the host is the driving force behind speciation in this family, but the close genetic and morphological similarities among species suggest that they are of recent origin.\nThe family contains two genera:\n\n"}, "Montmartre (1931 film)": {"views": 142.71428571428572, "completeness": 151, "summary": "Montmartre (French: Faubourg Montmartre) is a 1931 French drama film directed by Raymond Bernard and starring Gaby Morlay, Line Noro and Florelle.

One of the transfusions was contaminated, and van Grafhorst contracted HIV.Van Grafhorst's parents enrolled her in a Kincumber, New South Wales pre-school in February 1985, but she bit another child. The state medical officer for New South Wales said she should be barred from daycare until she was older, and after her condition became known, parents of other preschoolers threatened to withdraw their children if she was re-enrolled, saying that young Eve posed a grave threat of infection. She was eventually permitted to attend school, provided she wore a plastic face-mask at all times; some parents suggested that this was not sufficient, and that the van Grafhorsts should leave town.\nThe van Grafhorsts did indeed leave town, moving to Hastings, New Zealand in 1986. In contrast to their Australian experience, the van Grafhorst family was welcomed; Eve lived a relatively normal life and attended a local school without incident.\nIn 1992 she received the Variety Gold Heart Award.

Jorn, 400 U.S. 470 (1971), was a United States Supreme Court decision clarifying when a criminal defendant may be retried after a mistrial. In this case, where a trial judge abruptly declared a mistrial to prevent the prosecution's witness from incriminating himself, a second trial was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nJorn was charged with numerous counts of assisting in the preparation of fraudulent income tax returns. He was tried in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. Among the government's witnesses were five taxpayers whom Jorn had allegedly assisted in preparing fraudulent returns. As the first of these witnesses was called, the trial judge became concerned the witness was about to incriminate himself, and refused to allow the witness to testify until the same had consulted an attorney. Upon learning that all five witnesses were in the same situation, the judge discharged the jury and aborted the trial. The case was then set for retrial before a different jury, but Jorn argued that retrial was forbidden by double jeopardy.\nThe question of when a retrial is permitted after a mistrial is flexible and depends on the circumstances of the case. Here, the trial judge had acted sua sponte, abruptly discharging the jury without input from either the prosecution or defense. The Court used the framework of United States v. Perez to evaluate this action, asking whether there was \"manifest necessity\" to declare the mistrial. Here, the Court concluded, \"the trial judge here abused his discretion in discharging the jury,\" suggesting instead the possibility of a continuance. Justice Harlan pointed out the potential injustice of subjecting the defendant to a second trial, writing, \"Reprosecution after a mistrial has unnecessarily been declared ... subjects the defendant to ... personal strain and insecurity.\"\nIn conclusion, since there was not \"manifest necessity\" for the trial judge to declare the mistrial, Jorn could not be reprosecuted.\n\n"}, "Comparative embryology": {"views": 944.7142857142857, "completeness": 263, "summary": "Comparative embryology is the branch of embryology that compares and contrasts embryos of different species, showing how all animals are related. \n\n"}, "Meri\u00e7 Aral": {"views": 1401.5714285714287, "completeness": 199, "summary": "Meri\u00e7 Aral (born 17 November 1988) is a Turkish actress.

The  Greek Septuagint, the  Old Latin bible and related bible versions include both Esdras \u0391\u02b9 (English title: 1 Esdras) and Esdras \u0392\u02b9 (Ezra\u2013Nehemiah) as separate books.\nThere is scope for considerable confusion with references to 1 Esdras. The name refers primarily to translations of the original Greek 'Esdras A'. The Septuagint calls it Esdras A, while the Vulgate calls it 3 Esdras. It was considered apocryphal by Jerome. The Vulgate book of Ezra, translated from the Hebrew was, from the 8th century onwards, occasionally split into two books, which were then denoted 1 Esdras (Ezra) and 2 Esdras (Nehemiah) respectively. Vulgate Bible editions of the 13th century, and in what later became the usage of the Clementine Vulgate and the Anglican Articles of Religion, '1 Esdras' is applied to the Book of Ezra; while the Book of Nehemiah corresponds to '2 Esdras'. Septuagint version Esdras A is called in the Clementine Vulgate 3 Esdras. The 'Apocalypse of Ezra', an additional work associated with the name Ezra, is denoted '4 Esdras' in the Clementine Vulgate and  the Articles of Religion, but called '2 Esdras' in the King James Version and in most modern English bibles. 1 Esdras continues to be accepted as canonical by Eastern Orthodoxy and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, with 2 Esdras varying in canonicity between particular denominations within the Eastern churches.Overwhelmingly, citations in early Christian writings claimed from the scriptural 'Book of Ezra' (without any qualification) are taken from 1 Esdras, and never from the 'Ezra' sections of Ezra\u2013Nehemiah (Septuagint 'Esdras B') ;  the majority of early citations being taken from the 1 Esdras section containing the 'Tale of the Three Guardsmen', which is interpreted as Christological prophecy.\n\n"}, "\u0141\u0105kocin": {"views": 36.57142857142857, "completeness": 24, "summary": "\u0141\u0105kocin [w\u0254n\u02c8k\u0254t\u0361\u0255in] (German: Gr\u00fcnwiese) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Inowroc\u0142aw, within Inowroc\u0142aw County, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, in north-central Poland.\n\n"}, "National Lampoon This Side of Parodies": {"views": 77.71428571428571, "completeness": 64, "summary": "National Lampoon This Side of Parodies is an American humor book that was published by Warner Paperback Books in 1974.

The bomber is capable of carrying up to 70,000 pounds (32,000 kg) of weapons, and has a typical combat range of more than 8,800 miles (14,080 km) without aerial refueling.Beginning with the successful contract bid in June 1946, the B-52 design evolved from a straight wing aircraft powered by six turboprop engines to the final prototype YB-52 with eight turbojet engines and swept wings. The B-52 took its maiden flight in April 1952. Built to carry nuclear weapons for Cold War-era deterrence missions, the B-52 Stratofortress replaced the Convair B-36 Peacemaker. A veteran of several wars, the B-52 has dropped only conventional munitions in combat. The B-52's official name Stratofortress is rarely used; informally, the aircraft has become commonly referred to as the BUFF (Big Ugly Fat Fucker/Fella).The B-52 has been in service with the USAF since 1955. As of June 2019, 58 are in service, 18 in reserve, and about 12 in long-term storage. The bombers flew under the Strategic Air Command (SAC) until it was disestablished in 1992 and its aircraft absorbed into the Air Combat Command (ACC); in 2010, all B-52 Stratofortresses were transferred from the ACC to the new Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC).

QMCF plasmids carry a combination of regulatory sequences from mouse polyomavirus (Py) DNA replication origin which in combination with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA-1 protein binding site as nuclear retention elements ensure stable propagation of plasmids in mammalian cells. In addition the vectors carry the selection marker operational for selection of plasmid carrying bacteria and QMCF cells, bacterial ColE1 origin of replication, and cassette for expression of protein of interest. QMCF cell lines express Large-T antigen and EBNA-1 proteins which bind the viral sequences on the QMCF plasmid and hence support plasmid replication and maintenance in the cells. QMCF Technology has several important differences compared to commonly known transient expression and stable cell line expression systems. Unlike in transient expression system, QMCF Technology enables to maintain episomally replicating QMCF plasmids inside the cells for up to 50 days thus providing an option for production phase of 2\u20133 weeks. Therefore, the production levels of QMCF Technology are higher (up to 1g/L). Another difference is the option of establishing expression cell banks within one week, which is not feasible with transient system. Compared to usage of stable cell line, QMCF technology is a rapid method leaving out time-consuming clone selection step during cell line development.\n\n"}, "Vancouver Film Critics Circle Awards 2015": {"views": 87.0, "completeness": 298, "summary": "The nominations for the 16th Vancouver Film Critics Circle Awards, honoring the best in filmmaking in 2015, were announced on December 14, 2015.

Thus, rewriting some data requires an already-used-portion of flash to be read, updated, and written to a new location, together with initially erasing the new location if it was previously used at some point in time.  Due to the way flash works, much larger portions of flash must be erased and rewritten than actually required by the amount of new data.  This multiplying effect increases the number of writes required over the life of the SSD, which shortens the time it can operate reliably. The increased writes also consume bandwidth to the flash memory, which reduces random write performance to the SSD. Many factors will affect the WA of an SSD; some can be controlled by the user and some are a direct result of the data written to and usage of the SSD.\nIntel and SiliconSystems (acquired by Western Digital in 2009) used the term write amplification in their papers and publications as early as 2008. WA is typically measured by the ratio of writes committed to the flash memory to the writes coming from the host system. Without compression, WA cannot drop below one. Using compression, SandForce has claimed to achieve a write amplification of 0.5, with best-case values as low as 0.14 in the SF-2281 controller."}, "Edmund Malura": {"views": 50.57142857142857, "completeness": 37, "summary": "Edmund \"Eddy\" Malura (born 24 June 1955) is a former professional German footballer.Malura made 246 appearances over a decade in the 2.

Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation. Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil. Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.Wood-decay fungi can be classified according to the type of decay that they cause. The best-known types are brown rot, soft rot, and white rot. Each produce different enzymes, can degrade different plant materials, and can colonise different environmental niches. The residual products of decomposition from fungal action have variable pH, solubility and redox potentials. Over time this residue will become incorporated in the soil and sediment, so can have a noticeable effect on the environment of that area.\n\n"}, "Barrett Deems": {"views": 529.8571428571429, "completeness": 97, "summary": "Barrett Deems (March 1, 1914 \u2013 September 15, 1998) was an American swing drummer from Springfield, Illinois.

This can be, for example, to drive nails into wood, to shape metal (as with a forge), or to crush rock. Hammers are used for a wide range of driving, shaping, breaking and non-destructive striking applications. Traditional disciplines include carpentry, blacksmithing, warfare, and percussive musicianship (as with a gong).\nHammering is use of a hammer in its strike capacity, as opposed to prying with an secondary claw or grappling with a secondary hook. Carpentry and blacksmithing hammers are generally wielded from a stationary stance against a stationary target as gripped and propelled with one arm, in a lengthy downward planar arc\u2014downward to add kinetic energy to the impact\u2014pivoting mainly around the shoulder and elbow, with a small but brisk wrist rotation shortly before impact; for extreme impact, concurrent motions of the torso and knee can lower the shoulder joint during the swing to further increase the length of the swing arc (but this is tiring). War hammers are often wielded in non-vertical planes of motion, with a far greater share of energy input provided from the legs and hips, which can also include a lunging motion, especially against moving targets. Small mallets can be swung from the wrists in a smaller motion permitting a much higher cadence of repeated strikes. Use of hammers and heavy mallets for demolition must adapt the hammer stroke to the location and orientation of the target, which can necessitate a clubbing or golfing motion with a two-handed grip.\nThe modern hammer head is typically made of steel which has been heat treated for hardness, and the handle (also known as a haft or helve) is typically made of wood or plastic.\nUbiquitous in framing, the claw hammer has a \"claw\" to pull nails out of wood, and is commonly found in an inventory of household tools in North America. Other types of hammer vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their purposes. Hammers used in many trades include sledgehammers, mallets, and ball-peen hammers. Although most hammers are hand tools, powered hammers, such as steam hammers and trip hammers, are used to deliver forces beyond the capacity of the human arm. There are over 40 different types of hammers that have many different types of uses.For hand hammers, the grip of the shaft is an important consideration. Many forms of hammering by hand are heavy work, and perspiration can lead to slippage from the hand, turning a hammer into a dangerous or destructive uncontrolled projectile. Steel is highly elastic and transmits shock and vibration; steel is also a good conductor of heat, making it unsuitable for contact with bare skin in frigid conditions. Modern hammers with steel shafts are almost invariably clad with a synthetic polymer to improve grip, dampen vibration, and to provide thermal insulation. A suitably contoured handle is also an important aid in providing a secure grip during heavy use. Traditional wooden handles were reasonably good in all regards, but lack strength and durability compared to steel, and there are safety issues with wooden handles if the head becomes loose on the shaft.\nThe high elasticity of the steel head is important in energy transfer, especially when used in conjunction with an equally elastic anvil.\nIn terms of human physiology, many uses of the hammer involve coordinated ballistic movements under intense muscular forces which must be planned in advance at the neuromuscular level, as they occur too rapidly for conscious adjustment in flight. For this reason, accurate striking at speed requires more practice than a tapping movement to the same target area. It has been suggested that the cognitive demands for pre-planning, sequencing and accurate timing associated with the related ballistic movements of throwing, clubbing, and hammering precipitated aspects of brain evolution in early hominids."}, "22nd parallel north": {"views": 1157.4285714285713, "completeness": 98, "summary": "The 22nd parallel north is a circle of latitude that is 22 degrees north of the Earth's equatorial plane.

However, language and ethnicity are not the same. Moreover, neither element can be tied to a particular physical type.Although the possession of a common language shows that its speakers have lived together and have a common history, peoples also change languages. This is particularly so in Chad, where the openness of the terrain, marginal rainfall, frequent drought and famine, and low population densities have encouraged physical and linguistic mobility. Slave raids among non-Muslim peoples, internal slave trade, and exports of captives northward from the ninth to the twentieth centuries also have resulted in language changes.\nAnthropologists view ethnicity as being more than genetics. Like language, ethnicity implies a shared heritage, partly economic, where people of the same ethnic group may share a livelihood, and partly social, taking the form of shared ways of doing things and organizing relations among individuals and groups. Ethnicity also involves a cultural component made up of shared values and a common worldview. Like language, ethnicity is not immutable. Shared ways of doing things change over time and alter a group's perception of its own identity.\nNot only do the social aspects of ethnic identity change but the biological composition (or gene pool) also may change over time. Although most ethnic groups emphasize intermarriage, people are often proscribed from seeking partners among close relatives\u2014a prohibition that promotes biological variation. In all groups, the departure of some individuals or groups and the integration of others also changes the biological component.\nThe Chadian government has avoided official recognition of ethnicity. With the exception of a few surveys conducted shortly after independence, little data were available on this important aspect of Chadian society. Nonetheless, ethnic identity was a significant component of life in Chad.\nThe peoples of Chad carry significant ancestry from Eastern, Central, Western, and Northern Africa.Chad's languages fall into ten major groups, each of which belongs to either the\nNilo-Saharan, Afro-Asiatic, or Niger\u2013Congo language family. These represent three of the four major language families in Africa; only the Khoisan languages of southern Africa are not represented. The presence of such different languages suggests that the Lake Chad Basin may have been an important point of dispersal in ancient times.\n\n"}, "Gerrit David Gratama": {"views": 83.28571428571429, "completeness": 323, "summary": "Gerrit David Gratama (22 March 1874  \u2013 20 August 1965), was a Dutch artist, writer, and director of the Frans Hals Museum."}, "Order of the Nation (Antigua and Barbuda)": {"views": 761.2857142857143, "completeness": 707, "summary": "The Most Distinguished Order of the Nation is an Antiguan and Barbudan order of chivalry recognising distinguished and outstanding service to Antigua and Barbuda, the Caricom region or the international community.

It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, bordering Tibet of China to the north, and India in the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the largest city. \nThe name \"Nepal\" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, the era in ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country. In the middle of the first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet. The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley's traders. The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture. By the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers. The country was never colonized but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India. Parliamentary democracy was introduced in 1951 but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. The Nepalese Civil War in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular republic in 2008, ending the world's last Hindu monarchy.\nThe Constitution of Nepal, adopted in 2015, affirms Nepal as a secular federal parliamentary republic divided into seven provinces. It remains the only multi-party, fully democratic nation in the world currently ruled by a communist party. Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and friendship treaties were signed with India in 1950 and the China in 1960. Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat of the SAARC, of which it is a founding member. Nepal is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Bay of Bengal Initiative. The Nepalese Armed Forces are the fifth-largest in South Asia; and are notable for their Gurkha history, particularly during the world wars, and has been a significant contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations.\n\n"}, "Mariam Dabboussy": {"views": 775.1428571428571, "completeness": 323, "summary": "Mariam Dabboussy is an Australian woman who lived in Daesh controlled Syria.Dabboussy told The New York Times that she never planned to enter Daesh territory.

Washington voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote, pitting the Republican Party's nominee, incumbent President Donald Trump, and running mate Vice President Mike Pence against Democratic Party nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his running mate California Senator Kamala Harris.  Washington has 12 electoral votes in the Electoral College.Prior to the election, most news organizations forecast Washington as a state that Biden would win, or a safe blue state. Biden won the state by almost 20 points, the largest winning margin for a presidential candidate of any party since 1964. He also flipped the swing county of Clallam, which now holds the record for having voted for the winning presidential candidate since 1980. Biden also became the candidate with the highest vote total in the state's history, with 2,369,612 votes.The Seattle area, home to almost two-thirds of the state's population, is overwhelmingly Democratic. However, Trump won a considerable majority in outlying communities, garnering over 70% of the vote in rural counties such as Columbia. Eastern Washington is very rural and leans Republican, partly due to the strong tinge of social conservatism it shares with neighboring Idaho, a GOP stronghold. That said, Biden was able to improve on Clinton's margin in Whitman County--anchored by the college town of Pullman--increasing it from 4.1% in 2016 to 10.2% in 2020, the best performance for a Democrat in the county since 1936. In addition, he narrowed Trump's margin in Spokane County from 8.4% to 4.3%. Biden earned 75% of the vote in King County, home to Seattle. This was the largest margin by any candidate in a presidential race since the county's creation.Per exit polls by the Associated Press, Biden's strength in Washington came from 59% among progressive white voters and 79% among Asian-Americans. 34% of voters were secular and supported Biden by 78%. Biden also became the first Democrat since Washington's admission into the union to win the presidency without winning Mason County, the first Democrat since JFK in 1960 to prevail without winning Cowlitz County, and the first Democrat since Woodrow Wilson in 1916 to prevail without winning Grays Harbor County and Pacific County."}, "The Apache Relay": {"views": 409.7142857142857, "completeness": 182, "summary": "The Apache Relay was an American folk-rock band based out of Nashville, Tennessee.

While the phrase commonly refers to champagne, EU countries legally reserve that term for products exclusively produced in the Champagne region of France. Sparkling wine is usually either white or ros\u00e9, but there are examples of red sparkling wines such as the Italian Brachetto, Bonarda and Lambrusco, and the Australian sparkling Shiraz. The sweetness of sparkling wine can range from very dry brut styles to sweeter doux varieties (French for 'hard' and 'soft', respectively).The sparkling quality of these wines comes from its carbon dioxide content and may be the result of natural fermentation, either in a bottle, as with the traditional method, in a large tank designed to withstand the pressures involved (as in the Charmat process), or as a result of simple carbon dioxide injection in some cheaper sparkling wines.\nIn EU countries, the word \"champagne\" is reserved by law only for sparkling wine from the Champagne region of France. The French terms Mousseux and Cr\u00e9mant refer to sparkling wine not made in the Champagne region, such as Blanquette de Limoux produced in Southern France. Sparkling wines are produced around the world, and are often referred to by their local name or region, such as Prosecco, Franciacorta, Trento DOC, Oltrep\u00f2 Pavese Metodo Classico and Asti from Italy (the generic Italian term for sparkling wine being spumante), Espumante from Portugal, Cava from Spain, and Cap Classique from South Africa. Sparkling wines have been produced in Central and Eastern Europe since the early 19th-century. \"Champagne\" was further popularised in the region, late in the century, when J\u00f3zsef T\u00f6rley started production in Hungary using French methods, learned as an apprentice in Reims. T\u00f6rley has since become one of the largest European producers of sparkling wine. The United States is a significant producer of sparkling wine today, with producers in numerous states.

He was the younger brother and chief political advisor of South Vietnam's first president, Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m. Although he held no formal executive position, he wielded immense unofficial power, exercising personal command of both the ARVN Special Forces (a paramilitary unit which served as the Ng\u00f4 family's de facto private army) and the C\u1ea7n Lao political apparatus (also known as the Personalist Labor Party) which served as the regime's de facto secret police.\nIn his early age, Nhu was a quiet and bookish individual who showed little inclination towards the political path taken by his elder brothers. While training as an archivist in France, Nhu adopted the Roman Catholic ideology of personalism, although critics claimed that he misused that philosophy. Upon returning to Vietnam, he helped his brother in his quest for political power, and Nhu proved an astute and ruthless tactician and strategist, helping Di\u1ec7m to gain more leverage and outwit rivals. During this time, he formed and handpicked the members of the secret C\u1ea7n Lao Party, which swore its personal allegiance to the Ng\u00f4 family, provided their power base and eventually became their secret police force. Nhu remained as its head until his own assassination.\nIn 1955, Nhu's supporters helped intimidate the public and rig the 1955 State of Vietnam referendum that ensconced his elder brother, Di\u1ec7m, in power. Nhu used the C\u1ea7n Lao, which he organised into cells, to infiltrate every part of society to root out opposition to the Ng\u00f4 family. In 1959, he organized a failed assassination attempt via mail bomb on Prince Sihanouk, the prime minister of neighbouring Cambodia, with whom relations had become strained. Nhu publicly extolled his own intellectual abilities. He was known for making such public statements as promising to demolish the X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i Pagoda and vowing to kill his estranged father-in-law, Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng, who was the regime's ambassador to the United States, after the elder man condemned the Ng\u00f4 family's behavior and disowned his daughter, Nhu's wife, Madame Nhu.In 1963, the Ng\u00f4 family's grip on power became unstuck during the Buddhist crisis, during which the nation's Buddhist majority rose up against the pro-Catholic regime. Nhu tried to break the Buddhists' opposition by using the Special Forces in raids on prominent Buddhist temples that left hundreds dead, and framing the regular army for it. However, Nhu's plan was uncovered, which intensified plots by military officers, encouraged by the Americans, who turned against the Ng\u00f4 family after the pagoda attacks. Nhu was aware of the plots, but remained confident he could outmaneuver them, and began to plot a counter-coup, as well as the assassinations of US Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. and other American and opposition figures. Nhu was fooled by the loyalist General T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t \u0110\u00ednh, who had turned against the Ng\u00f4 family. On 1 November 1963, the coup proceeded, and the Ng\u00f4 brothers (Nhu and Di\u1ec7m) were detained and assassinated the next day."}, "Journal of Electromagnetic Waves and Applications": {"views": 137.8, "completeness": 115, "summary": "The Journal of Electromagnetic Waves and Applications is a peer-reviewed scientific journal published by Taylor & Francis in 18 issues per year.

Gait variabilities seen are attributed to the defective inputs from the Basal Ganglia. However, there is altered activation of other cortical areas that support the deficient control to bring about a movement and maintain some functional mobility.Transcranial direct-current stimulation is a modification of the traditionally available direct current applied with 2 saline soaked electrodes (active and reference: 5-35 cm2) with active placed at the area to be stimulated and reference electrode placed at the contralateral supraorbital region in the forehead. Focality of the current passes depends upon the position of the electrode, its dimensions and the current density. The duration of the stimulation varies from 5-20 mins with intensities of 0.5-2.0 mA.  It has been successfully introduced as a promising therapeutic adjuvant in various rehabilitation procedures.

She contracted \"bulbo-spinal\"  polio at age 3 in 1950 and was confined to an iron lung for the rest of her life. Due to a spinal deformity caused by the polio, she was unable to change to a portable breathing device introduced in the late 1950s. Odell's condition was not as severe in youth and she could spend short periods outside the machine until her 20s, from then on she needed to be in it 24 hours a day. Caregivers could still slide Odell's bedding out of her iron lung for basic nursing care but only briefly.\nOdell was one of the longest time users of an iron lung, being confined to it for nearly 60 years. By 2018, only 3 people in the United States still rely on iron lungs. Odell's iron lung, which was seven feet long and weighed 750 pounds, produced positive and negative pressures that forced air into her lungs and then expelled it. She lay on her back with only her head exposed and made eye contact with visitors through an angled mirror. She was able to operate a television set with a small blow tube. She was cared for by her parents, other family members and aides provided by a nonprofit foundation.Odell had many successes in her life despite her condition. Although she could not attend high school, she completed her studies by having her classmates or teachers bring school assignments to her home, where she would read the answers into a Dictaphone or have friends or family transcribe them. She also learned to write with her toes. She graduated from high school in 1965 and subsequently took long-distance classes from Freed-Hardeman University. Although she was unable to earn a degree, she received an honorary degree in 1987. In 1992, Odell was profiled in Woman's World magazine and received the Paul Harris Fellow Award from the Jackson Rotary Club, one of the club's highest honors.In 1991, Odell began writing a children's book using a voice activated computer, even though it took 10 years to accomplish. Published in 2001, about 5,000 copies of the book, Blinky, Less Light, have been sold. Shortly after the book was published, Dianne met former Vice President Al Gore at a Christmas Gala in her honor. This book was briefly mentioned by actress Jane Seymour in her 2004 work Remarkable Changes: Turning Life's Challenges into Opportunities. Dianne first met Seymour in 2003 who also introduced her to Christopher Reeve.Despite her condition, friends say that Odell accepted her life with grace. In a 1994 interview with the Associated Press, she stated that \"I've had a very good life, filled with love and family and faith. You can make life good or you can make it bad.\" In a 2001 interview with The Associated Press, Odell said she wrote her children's book to show youngsters, especially those with physical disabilities, that they should never give up. \"It's amazing what you can accomplish if you see someone do the same thing,\" she said.Her medical costs were approximately $60,000 per year. However, her family refused to institutionalize her. To help the family, the West Tennessee Healthcare Foundation and the Campbell Street Church of Christ established the Dianne Odell Fund. In 2001, a website was set up to provide users with a brief biography of Odell and a way to donate money or services to help with her care. A number of fundraisers, some featuring celebrities, were also held to raise money to allow her to remain at home.\nOn February 17, 2007 (the Saturday following her 60th birthday), she was temporarily moved to The New Southern Hotel in Jackson, for celebrations attended by approximately 200 guests and with a nine-foot birthday cake. She also received letters from well-wishes from people all over the country. That same month, a German film crew visited Dianne to do a story about her life.Odell's life was threatened by power outages in 1957 and 1974 which disabled her respirator. However, she survived with the help of her family who hand-pumped the respirator until power was restored. In 1995, the Tennessee Valley Authority provided the Odell family with a generator large enough to power the house, in case of future power outages.\nOdell died on May 28, 2008 at age 61.

The focometer is monocular and hand-held, and is normally used in natural lighting. Patients rotate a collar on the focometer until the best focus is achieved.  The individual's refractive power is then read off a linear dioptre scale.\nThe focometer was developed by Drs. Ian Berger and Larry Spitzberg at the University of Houston College of Optometry in Houston, Texas, to provide a simple, inexpensive means for measuring refractive error in human vision. The portable, hand-held instrument is highly appropriate for use in remote and poor areas.\nFocometers measure spherical refractive errors. Astigmatism can also be measured using a \"clock target\" with the device. A study has found, however, that the focometer is less effective for identifying astigmatism than an autorefractor, and that its axis accuracy is limited to 15\u00b0.The advantages of a focometer over other methods for use in developing countries are that it is lightweight, compact, relatively inexpensive, fairly quick, and easy to use with minimal training. A clinical trial compared the repeatability, validity, and ease of use of the focometer with an autorefractor. It found that the focometer results were within 0.75 dioptres of the autorefractor value 84% of the time. The authors found that repeatability of the measurements improved when patients were allowed to \"practice\" twice on each eye before taking the real reading.\n\n"}, "Iraqi Republic (1958\u20131968)": {"views": 3845.1428571428573, "completeness": 1969, "summary": "The Iraqi Republic (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642\u064a\u0629\u200e al-Jumh\u016br\u012byah al-'Ir\u0101q\u012byah), colloquially known as the First Iraqi Republic was a state forged in 1958 under the rule of President Muhammad Najib ar-Ruba'i and Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim. ar-Ruba'i and Qasim first came to power through the  14 July Revolution in which the Kingdom of Iraq's Hashemite monarchy was overthrown.

Arjuna's wrestling bout with the Kirata is said to be this very struggle. More than Shiva in disguise, the Kirata is said to personify the barbaric energy locked up within each individual.

It premiered February 9, 1756, at the Teatro Argentina in Rome. The Italian libretto was written by Pietro Metastasio, who was considered to be the most important opera seria librettist. Antigono was the only opera that Gluck ever premiered in Rome. This allowed him to reuse several arias and an entire introduction from some of his other operas, L'innocenza giustificata, Le cinesi, and La danza.Gluck came to Rome from Vienna after Christmas in 1755. He worked quickly, since Antigono premiered only two months later. The premier of the opera was sold out and the audience seemed to have enjoyed it; several arias and a duet were encored at the end of the show. After the premier of the opera, Pope Benedict XIV awarded Gluck with the title of Cavalier of the Order of the Golden Spur. This was an important honor for Gluck, which Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had received previously. During Gluck's time in Rome, he was under the protection of Cardinal Albani.Because the authorities in Rome had strict rules against women performing on the stage, the entire cast of Antigono was made up of men, including castrati. The opera was written for four sopranos, one contralto, and one tenor, who played the protagonist Antigono.\n\n"}, "Dwight James Baum": {"views": 296.85714285714283, "completeness": 615, "summary": "Dwight James Baum (June 24, 1886 \u2013 December 14, 1939) was an American architect most active in New York and in Sarasota, Florida.

While a few species are pathogenic, most are benign, and have been found to thrive in a broad range of environments, including soil, water, and eukaryotic cells. Some species have large genomes, including the 9.7 megabasepair genome (67% G/C) of Rhodococcus sp. RHA1.Strains of Rhodococcus are important owing to their ability to catabolize a wide range of compounds and produce bioactive steroids, acrylamide, and acrylic acid, and their involvement in fossil fuel biodesulfurization. This genetic and catabolic diversity is not only due to the large bacterial chromosome, but also to the presence of three large linear plasmids. Rhodococcus  is also an experimentally advantageous system owing to a relatively fast growth rate and simple developmental cycle, but is not well characterized.Another important application of Rhodococcus comes from bioconversion, using biological systems to convert cheap starting material into more valuable compounds, such as its ability to metabolize harmful environmental pollutants, including toluene, naphthalene, herbicides, and PCBs. Rhodococcus species typically metabolize aromatic substrates by first oxygenating the aromatic ring to form a diol (two alcohol groups). Then, the ring is cleaved with  intra/extradiol mechanisms, opening the ring and exposing the substrate to further metabolism. Since the chemistry is very stereospecific, the diols are created with predictable chirality. While controlling the chirality of chemical reaction presents a significant challenge for synthetic chemists, biological processes can be used instead to faithfully produce chiral molecules in cases where direct chemical synthesis is not feasible or efficient. An example of this is the use of Rhodococcus  to produce indene, a precursor to the AIDS drug indinavir, a protease inhibitor, and containing two of the five chiral centers needed in the complex.\n\n"}, "Golf at the 2018 Mediterranean Games": {"views": 81.71428571428571, "completeness": 407, "summary": "The 2018 Mediterranean Games (Spanish: Juegos Mediterr\u00e1neos de 2018), officially known as the XVIII Mediterranean Games (Spanish: XVIII Juegos Mediterr\u00e1neos) and commonly known as Tarragona 2018, was an international multi-sport event held from 22 June to 1 July 2018 in Tarragona, Spain.

It is commonly misconstrued to be the house of Blaine A. Marks. The house dates back to 1833 and was built by James Hall, a retired ship's captain. James G. Blaine, then the Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, purchased it in 1862 as a present for his wife, the former Harriet Stanwood, daughter of a prominent Augusta family.  Blaine substantially enlarged the building, constructing an addition at the rear that was a near replica of the original structure, and removing interior walls to create a large entertainment space.During World War I the house was used by Maine's Committee for Public Safety. It was presented to the State by Blaine's youngest daughter, Mrs. Harriet Blaine Beale, and established by the 1919 Legislature as the official residence of the Governor of Maine. It was remodeled, to designs by the noted Maine architect John Calvin Stevens, prior to the first governor taking residence in 1921. Carl E. Miliken was the first governor to occupy the residence.The Blaine House was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964, for its association with Blaine, an influential political and diplomatic figure on the national stage in the decades following the Civil War.In June 2014, a system of high efficiency heat pumps was installed in the Blaine House in an effort to reduce the heating bill, after a test of one over the winter in the Governor's sleeping quarters.

Arrestin beta 2, like arrestin beta 1, was shown to inhibit beta-adrenergic receptor function in vitro. It is expressed at high levels in the central nervous system and may play a role in the regulation of synaptic receptors. Besides the brain, a cDNA for arrestin beta 2 was isolated from thyroid gland, and thus it may also be involved in hormone-specific desensitization of TSH receptors. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene, but the full-length nature of some variants has not been defined.The protein may interact with the agonist DOI in 5-HT2A receptor signaling.Arrestin beta 2 is crucial for the development of tolerance to morphine and other opioids.\n\n"}, "Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest 1970": {"views": 149.14285714285714, "completeness": 1023, "summary": "Yugoslavia participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 27 times, debuting in 1961 and competing every year until its last appearance in 1992, with the exceptions of 1977\u20131980 and 1985.

Besides North America, dialects of ASL and ASL-based creoles are used in many countries around the world, including much of West Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. ASL is also widely learned as a second language, serving as a lingua franca. ASL is most closely related to French Sign Language (LSF). It has been proposed that ASL is a creole language of LSF, although ASL shows features atypical of creole languages, such as agglutinative morphology. \nASL originated in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in West Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely by schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken. Reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of oral language to sign language.\nASL signs have a number of phonemic components, such as movement of the face, the torso, and the hands. ASL is not a form of pantomime although iconicity plays a larger role in ASL than in spoken languages.

The Italian victory was based on mobility and speed but was hampered by the terrain, rainy weather and British resistance.\nAt the Battle of Tug Argan (11\u201315 August) Italian attacks had the advantage of artillery and the outnumbered defenders were gradually worn down and slowly outflanked, until the remaining fortified hilltops were vulnerable to being captured piecemeal. After the failure of a counter-attack towards the Mirgo Pass, the local commander, Major-General Reade Godwin-Austen had too few men to retrieve the situation and to keep open an escape route at the same time and was given permission to retreat towards Berbera.\nThe British fought a rearguard action at Barkasan on 17 August and retreated after dark but the improvised evacuation went better than expected and the second blocking position at Nasiyeh was not needed. The rainy weather continued to slow the Italian advance and when the airstrip near Berbera was found still to be garrisoned, a prospective Italian coup de main was made impractical. The British defeat was controversial and caused a deterioration in relations between General Archibald Wavell, the theatre commander, his subordinates and the Prime Minister Winston Churchill."}, "Marjorie Oludhe Macgoye": {"views": 677.5714285714286, "completeness": 1900, "summary": "Marjorie Phyllis Oludhe Macgoye (21 October 1928 \u2013 1 December 2015), also known as the mother of \u2018Kenyan literature\u2019 was born in Southampton, England, but immigrated to Kenya soon after Kenya became independent.

The county is administered as a unitary authority by Northumberland County Council, headquartered in Morpeth.The county of Northumberland included Newcastle upon Tyne until 1400, when the city became a county of itself. Northumberland expanded greatly in the Tudor period, annexing Berwick-upon-Tweed in 1482, Tynedale in 1495, Tynemouth in 1536, Redesdale around 1542 and Hexhamshire in 1572. Islandshire, Bedlingtonshire and Norhamshire were incorporated into Northumberland in 1844.

She was one of a number of women computers employed at Cambridge Observatory between 1876 and 1904. Unlike most of these women, Walker remained at the observatory for a significant period of time.\nWalker was born at Wickham Market, Suffolk in 1864. She was employed by the observatory in 1879 at the age of 15, and remained there for 24 years, working under astronomers John Couch Adams and Robert Stawell Ball. She worked most directly with the observatory's senior assistant at the time, Andrew Graham. The observatory necessitated that only two observers worked at any one time. Up until 1892, Walker substituted for Graham's current assistant Henry Todd when Todd's ill health prevented him from observing. That Walker was making transit observations with the meridian circle in the mid-1880s is clear from an observatory report that stated her work was interrupted by an earth tremor on 22 April 1884, when she had to stop while wires in the eyepiece vibrated. From 1892, Walker became Graham's observation partner and from 1894 to 1896, she observed alone.\n\nAndrew Graham retired in 1903 at the age of eighty-eight. Anne Walker resigned at the same time as him, bringing her astronomical career at the Cambridge Observatory to an end after 21 years.It has been suggested that Walker was much more than a routine computer, and that she took part in observations with Graham. If true, this makes her the second woman (after Caroline Herschel) to have been recorded formally engaging in night-time astronomical observations.\n\n"}, "Tavito Nanao discography": {"views": 74.28571428571429, "completeness": 50, "summary": "The discography of Tavito Nanao consists of 6 studio albums and 8 singles, released under major label Sony, before switching to independent label Wonderground Music in 2002 and later Felicity in 2012."}, "Oberst Chabert": {"views": 81.42857142857143, "completeness": 545, "summary": "Oberst Chabert is an opera (described by the composer as a \"musical tragedy in three acts\") by Hermann Wolfgang von Waltershausen, loosely adapted by the composer from the novel Colonel Chabert by Honor\u00e9 de Balzac.\n\n"}, "Gabriel Carroll": {"views": 1164.4285714285713, "completeness": 406, "summary": "Gabriel Drew Carroll (born December 24, 1982) is an Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Toronto.

The first World Under-20 Championship was held in 1974, although the IIHF considers the first three years to be unofficial invitational  tournaments. In 1977, the Ice Hockey World Championships became an \"open competition\" which allowed all players, professional and amateur, to participate. With National Hockey League (NHL) players participating in the tournament, IIHF officials began to fear that true amateurs and young players were losing their places. As a result, full world championship status was given to the World Under-20 Championship. Colloquially known as the World Junior Hockey Championship, the event was structured after the World Championships, but limited to players under the age of 20. During the first years of the tournament, Canada did not have a national team, instead choosing to send a club team, typically the Memorial Cup winner. In 1978, an all-star team was sent. The first national junior team participated in the 1982 tournament, and became the first Canadian team to win a gold medal. Canada has won more gold medals than any other nation and has had two five-year gold medal winning streaks, during 1993\u20131997 and 2005\u20132009. The Canadian team is usually composed mostly of players from the Canadian Hockey League, a major junior umbrella organization that consists of the Ontario Hockey League, Quebec Major Junior Hockey League and Western Hockey League.\nOne of the most infamous incidents in tournament history occurred in 1987 in Piestany, Czechoslovakia, where a massive brawl involving all players on both teams occurred between Canada and the Soviet Union. It began when Pavel Kostichkin took a two-handed slash at Theoren Fleury and the Soviet Union's Evgeny Davydov came off the bench, eventually leading to most of the players from both teams joining the brawl. The officials, unable to break up the fight, walked off the ice and eventually tried shutting off the arena lights, but the brawl lasted for 20 minutes before the game was declared null and void. An emergency IIHF meeting resulted in the delegates voting 7\u20131 to disqualify both teams from the tournament. While the Soviets were out of medal contention, Canada was playing for the gold medal, and were leading 4\u20132 at the time of the brawl. The gold medal ultimately went to Finland, hosts Czechoslovakia took the silver and Sweden, who had been eliminated from medal contention, was awarded the bronze. The IIHF voted to suspend all players involved from competing in international events for 18 months, and all coaches for three years. Player suspensions were later cut to six months, which allowed eligible players such as Fleury to participate in the 1988 tournament. The brawl helped raise the profile of the tournament in Canada, where the tournament now ranks as one of the most important hockey events.Since 1977, Canada has participated in every tournament, sending 673 players: 64 goaltenders and 609 skaters (forwards and defencemen). During this period, Canadian teams have won 29 medals: 16 gold, eight silver and five bronze. Canadian cities have hosted the tournament a combined 11 times, more than any other nation. Because of the age restrictions, the majority of players have participated in only one tournament. However, 142 players (131 skaters, 11 goaltenders) have played in two tournaments. Seven players\u2014Jason Botterill, Jay Bouwmeester, Ryan Ellis, Trevor Kidd, Martin Lapointe, Eric Lindros and Jason Spezza\u2014have played in three tournaments. As of 2015, 513 players (464 skaters and 49 goaltenders), or 76.3% of players, have won at least one medal. Of that number, 298 (29 goaltenders and 269 skaters), or 44.3% of all players, have won at least one gold medal. Forty-four players (41 skaters and 3 goaltenders), or 6.5%, have won two or more gold medals. Jason Botterill is the only Canadian player to win three gold medals (1994\u20131996), while three other players have also won three medals: Jason Spezza and Jay Bouwmeester (both 2000\u20132002) won two bronze and one silver, while Ryan Ellis (2009\u20132011) won a gold and two silvers. Eric Lindros, who scored 12 goals and 19 assists for a total of 31 points over three tournaments (1990\u20131992), is Canada's all-time assists and points leader in the tournament. Jordan Eberle, who played in the 2009 and 2010 tournaments, is Canada's all-time leading goal scorer, with 14 goals.\n\n"}, "Terrence O'Connor": {"views": 47.285714285714285, "completeness": 0, "summary": ""}, "Lawson Heights Suburban Centre, Saskatoon": {"views": 88.57142857142857, "completeness": 592, "summary": "Lawson Heights Suburban Centre is a neighbourhood that is maturing, and is located in north east Saskatoon.

Georgia voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote, pitting the Republican Party's nominee, incumbent President Donald Trump of Florida, and running mate Vice President Mike Pence of Indiana against Democratic Party nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden of Delaware, and his running mate California Senator Kamala Harris. Georgia has 16 electoral votes in the Electoral College.Biden narrowly won Georgia by a margin of 0.23% and 11,779 votes. Leading up to the election, Georgia was seen as a key swing state in both the presidential and senatorial elections\u2014both a regular Class II U.S. Senate election and a special election\u2014due to the rapid growth and diversification of Atlanta's suburbs, where Republicans were once dominant. Polls of the state throughout the campaign indicated a close race, and prior to election day, most news organizations considered Georgia a toss-up. This was the only state in the Deep South carried by Biden, made possible by significant racial demographic shifts over the previous decade, especially in Metro Atlanta.Like in other states, Trump had an early lead on election night due to the state counting in-person votes first on that day, before counting mail-in ballots over the following days. Biden subsequently cut into Trump's margin over the course of the week and eventually overtook Trump on Friday morning. Although majority-minority Burke County\u2014near Augusta\u2014flipped to Trump after supporting Hillary Clinton in 2016, Biden was able to build Clinton's vote shares in the densely populated Metro Atlanta counties of Gwinnett, Cobb, and Henry, increasing her vote shares of 51%, 48%, and 51% to 58%, 56%, and 60%, respectively. This helped Biden to narrowly win the state by a plurality, despite not flipping any counties.\nDue to the close margins in the initial election results, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced on November 11 that a full audit by hand would be conducted. The audit was completed on November 18, and Biden was confirmed to be the winner on November 19.Biden became the first Democrat to carry the state since Bill Clinton in 1992, as well as the first Democrat to win a statewide election in Georgia since 2006. Additionally, Biden became the first Democrat to carry a state in the Deep South since Bill Clinton carried Louisiana in 1996, as well as the first non-Southern Democrat to do so since John F. Kennedy in 1960. Biden also became the first Democrat to gain over 70% of the vote in Fulton County since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944.\nThis is the first time since 1992 that Georgia voted more Democratic than neighboring Florida and the first time since 2000 that it voted more Democratic than also-neighboring North Carolina. Additionally, it was the first time since 1860 that Laurens County and Monroe County did not vote for the statewide winner."}, "2019 World Allround Speed Skating Championships \u2013 Women": {"views": 66.0, "completeness": 72, "summary": "The Women competition at the 2019 World Allround Speed Skating Championships was held on 2 and 3 March 2019.\n\n"}, "EXTL2": {"views": 61.714285714285715, "completeness": 92, "summary": "Exostosin-like 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the EXTL2 gene.

He was the tenth and the youngest child in his family. His father, Thomas Davy, was a farmer. His mother, Sarah, was Thomas's second wife. She was the eldest daughter of William Gibson, surgeon of Carlton Colville and Willingham Hall, Beccles, Suffolk.Early in life Davy was apprenticed to a grocer at Halesworth, but his creative yearnings got the better of him and he left his apprenticeship to pursue drawing. Instead he became apprenticed to John Sell Cotman at Great Yarmouth, and assisted him in the etching of his Norfolk architectural views and illustrations of monumental brasses, published in 1818 and 1819. With this experience he issued his own series of ten etchings of Suffolk Antiquities including details of Beccles church, in 1818.\nIn 1824 he married Sarah Bardwell, daughter of a master mariner in Southwold. Until 1829 he lived and worked in Southwold as an instructor in drawing and sketching from nature, and in the production of his own watercolours and etchings. Between 1823 and 1827 he issued a Collection of sixty etchings of further Suffolk Antiquities in parts, and these were re-issued (printed by Deck, in Ipswich) together with the earlier ten as A Series of Etchings Illustrative of the Architectural Antiquities of Suffolk in 1827. By this date he had also produced a series of Views of the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen in Suffolk which contained only twenty plates, because, although many had subscribed, the funds contributed were not very large.In 1829 Davy moved to Ipswich and soon settled in Globe Street (now renamed St George's Street), from which address the large body of his subsequent etchings down to the 1860s were usually dated. His first years in Ipswich were difficult, and in 1833 he sold many of his books, plates and other possessions by auction. His later etchings, by which he is best known, were in general issued and sold individually. His preparations for them, at first showing particular attention to Suffolk churches, included a copious body of sketches, from which he distilled a mass of detail for the preparation of his plates. During the later 1830s and 1840s he also produced journalistic illustrations of public events \u2013 such as the Laying of the First Stone of Ipswich Docks (1839) \u2013 as well as making drawings of farming and agricultural subjects, and of archaeological finds.\n\n"}, "Michael Riedel (artist)": {"views": 145.14285714285714, "completeness": 681, "summary": "Michael Riedel (born July 12, 1972) is a contemporary artist who lives and works in Frankfurt.\n\n"}, "Pexicopia diasema": {"views": 32.57142857142857, "completeness": 33, "summary": "Pexicopia diasema is a moth of the family Gelechiidae.

Bogot\u00e1 is a territorial entity of the first order, with the same administrative status as the departments of Colombia. It is the political, economic, administrative and industrial center of the country.\nBogot\u00e1 was founded as the capital of the New Kingdom of Granada on 6 August 1538 by Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada after a harsh expedition into the Andes conquering the Muisca, the indigenous inhabitants of the Altiplano. Santaf\u00e9 (its name after 1540) became the seat of the government of the Spanish Royal Audiencia of the New Kingdom of Granada (created in 1550), and then after 1717 it was the capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada. After the Battle of Boyac\u00e1 on 7 August 1819, Bogot\u00e1 became the capital of the independent nation of Gran Colombia. It was Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar who rebaptized the city with the name of Bogot\u00e1, as a way of honoring the Muisca people and as an emancipation act towards the Spanish crown. Hence, since the Viceroyalty of New Granada's independence from the Spanish Empire and during the formation of present-day Colombia, Bogot\u00e1 has remained the capital of this territory.\nThe city is located in the center of Colombia, on a high plateau known as the Bogot\u00e1 savanna, part of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense located in the Eastern Cordillera of the Andes. Bogot\u00e1 is the third-highest capital in South America and in the world after Quito and La Paz, at an average of 2,640 meters (8,660 ft) above sea level.

The capital hosts the main financial market in Colombia and the Andean natural region, and is the leading destination for new foreign direct investment projects coming into Latin America and Colombia. It has the highest nominal GDP in the country, responsible for almost a quarter of the nation's total (24.7%).\nThe city's airport, El Dorado International Airport, named after the mythical El Dorado, handles the largest cargo volume in Latin America, and is third in number of people.

In the first of those games, against Cheshire, his 53* won him the man-of-the-match award.In the next round of the competition, in a match which proved to be Edwards' last at List A level, Cornwall were knocked out by Sussex, with Edwards playing purely as a batsman as Gavin Edwards took the gloves.\n\n"}, "Les Tourrettes": {"views": 72.85714285714286, "completeness": 23, "summary": "Les Tourrettes is a commune in the Dr\u00f4me department in southeastern France.\n\n"}, "SS Edwin G.

The ruckman is one of the most important players on the field.  They are often key to coaching strategy and winning centre clearances which result in the most goal kicking opportunities (inside 50s).\nThe role of the ruckman in Australian rules is similar to a lock in rugby union contesting a line-out.  The key differences are that with the exception of boundary throw-ins, the ball is almost always thrown straight up high into the air rather than horizontally, so in this respect, the ruckman is similar to a basketball centre.  The ruckman needs to be able to control the ball by palm tap or fist with outstretched arms.  Unlike rugby, the ruckman must rely on his vertical leap and is not assisted by teammates. Australian football rucking often involves vigorous mid-air collisions with the opposing ruckman.\nWith no offside or knock on rules, the ruckman can tap the ball in any direction.  Before a bounce down or ball up, ruckmen confer with the onballers (rovers and ruck-rovers) to pre-determine the direction of the tap so that they can position themselves to best receive it to the team's advantage.\nThe ruckman is typically the tallest player on either team.  A typical professional Australian Football League ruckman is over 200 cm or 6'7.\nWhen a ruckman beats his opponent by contacting the ball, it is called a hit out and measured as a statistic and performance indicator of effective ruckwork.   Although the ruckman is the primary player to score hit-outs, sometimes tall key position players fill in for the ruckman around the ground if the ruckman cannot run to make the contest in time.\nRucking is one of the most physically demanding positions on the ground, both in terms of fitness and body contact.  As a result of the high level of physical contact of clashing with opponents in the air, many ruckmen have large physiques or bulk up to prevent injury.  As well, due to the use of knees when jumping, many ruckmen wear protective thigh and shin padding, whereas players in other positions rarely do.  Coaches often field more than one ruckman and rotate them due to the physical pressure of the position and the endurance of having to run to ruck contests around the ground.\n\n"}, "Westerkwartier (municipality)": {"views": 235.0, "completeness": 48, "summary": "Westerkwartier is a municipality in the Netherlands, in the province of Groningen.\nThe municipality was formed on 1 January 2019, by the merger of the municipalities of Grootegast, Leek, Marum,  Zuidhorn and partly Winsum.\n\n"}, "Shahrak-e Resalat": {"views": 55.0, "completeness": 37, "summary": "Shahrak-e Resalat (Persian: \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0643 \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u062a\u200e, also Romanized as Shahrak-e Res\u0101lat) is a village in Aftab Rural District, Aftab District, Tehran County, Tehran Province, Iran.

He volunteered to serve in the German Army in the First World War, until after being wounded in 1916 on the Eastern Front in Galicia and being invalided as a Vice-Sergeant in the reserve. In 1919 he became qualified as a gymnastic and sports teacher at the Badische Landsturnanstalt. In 1922 he entered the German University for Physical Education in Berlin where he lectured alongside studying. His interest in the treatment of sport injuries led to him also entering the medical profession, qualifying as a medical doctor by 1934.He played as an amateur for VfR Mannheim and Tennis Borussia Berlin before being appointed as Germany's first national manager and selector in 1923. At the time, football was not a major sport in Germany, and German football was seen as considerably inferior to that played by other central European countries such as Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Italy. Nonetheless, under Nerz the team \u2014 initially considered one of the weakest in Europe \u2014 gradually developed some consistency towards the end of the 1920s and early 1930s. Nerz studied many league and cup games in England, as well as in Austria and Italy, and sought advice on coaching and tactics from internationally respected coaches such as Jimmy Hogan, Hugo Meisl and Vittorio Pozzo in a quest to improve the standards of the Germany national team.Germany declined to participate in the inaugural World Cup in 1930 in Uruguay, but by the time of the next tournament in 1934, held in Italy, Germany had become a strong side by European standards. In the event, Nerz guided Germany to victories over Belgium and Sweden; a semi-final defeat to Czechoslovakia was followed by a win over the hitherto heavily fancied Austrians to secure a third-place finish. This would be Germany's best international performance until the 1954 World Cup, and it provided a huge boost to the popularity of the sport in Germany.Dr. Otto Nerz had joined the Nazi Party relatively early, prior to Adolf Hitler gaining power in 1933; in the latter year he joined the SA, in which he rose to rank of Obersturmbannfuhrer by the end of the Second World War. This, combined with his success in the World Cup, meant that the German government placed a high level of expectation on Nerz's team for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, for which he was team coach. However, Germany was eliminated early in the tournament after a shock defeat to rank outsiders Norway. Shortly thereafter, Nerz was relieved of his duties as coach and replaced by assistant coach Sepp Herberger.Following his dismissal from the Germany national team, Nerz took an administrative and coaching position with the football association of Berlin. In 1936 he became lecturer at the Reich Academy for Physical Exercise and in 1938 he was appointed by Hitler as a professor in philosophy at the University of Berlin. During the Second World War he was deployed to a military hospital Reserve-Lazarett 21 at Berlin-Britz. In December 1944 he introduced daily exercise regimes for military hospital patients.Due to his Nazi Party membership, he was arrested as a prisoner of war by the British after the Battle of Berlin, then handed over to the occupying Soviet authorities who later interned him in a camp in Sachsenhausen; after four years of imprisonment, he died of cerebral edema on or around 18 April 1949 and was buried in a mass grave on the site of the camp.\n\n"}, "Mika K.": {"views": 185.14285714285714, "completeness": 616, "summary": "Mirjana Kosti\u0107 (Serbian Cyrillic: \u041c\u0438\u0440\u0458\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u045b; born 6 August 1983), professionally known as Mika K., is a Serbian singer and musician, who came to media attention as a contestant of talents show Operacija trijumf.\n\n"}, "InfoCision Management Corporation": {"views": 378.57142857142856, "completeness": 668, "summary": "InfoCision Management Corporation is a company that operates call centers.
